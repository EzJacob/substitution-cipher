# substitution-cipher
A program that implements a substitution cipher for encrypting messages. For decryption, it analyzes the frequency of characters in the encrypted message. The program identifies the most frequently occurring characters and maps them to common letters in the English language (e.g., 'E', 'T', 'A', etc.), attempting to reconstruct the original text using frequency analysis.
